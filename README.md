# hackocaml

OCaml hacking ideas, small and large. All the useful information is on the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/tarides/projects/32/views/1). This project board contains hacking ideas of various sizes and skill levels.  

## Adding ideas

Add a new item in the project board. Make sure to fill in the fields associated with estimated effort. It is not meant to be perfect. Ok to over or underestimate. If you are adding an item that is not already an issue, convert the item to an issue on this (https://github.com/tarides/hackocaml) repo. Add enough details so that someone can get started with just the details in the issue thread.

Interpret the duration labels as follows:

```
- 1 day     => < 1 day
- 1 week    => > 1 day && < 1 week
- 1 month   => > 1 week && < 1 month
- 1 quarter => > 1 month && < 1 quarter
- 1 year    => > 1 quarter && < 1 year
- 1 PhD     => > 1 year && open-ended
```

## Starting to work on an idea listed in the board

If you are keen to hack on an idea

1. If you have write access to the repo, assign the corresponding issue to yourself and start hacking. Otherwise, say so in the issue thread and start hacking. Someone will eventually assign you to the issue.
2. Update the status to "In Progress".

Building open-source software is a collaborative activity, and some larger projects will need more than one person's expertise. So, if you see a project that has been assigned to someone but would like also to participate, say so in the thread. It is very likely that there will be room for collaboration on complex projects.
